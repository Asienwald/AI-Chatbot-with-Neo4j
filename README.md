## Features
This chatbot was built to mirror and query a real-time map of happenings in SP through the use of a graph database to provide a smoother experience to visitors new to SP when they visit for events/open houses.

- chatbot is able to answer simple queries about SP based on the data it was trained with
- chatbot is able to find shortest distances between 2 nodes which is representative of the distance between the 2 locations on the SP map
    - can also get extra info about each building or facility and current events happening on the SP map mapped out in the neo4j graph database
